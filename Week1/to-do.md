Week 1 (Basics — 7 days)

    JS syntax: let/const, types, operators. ✅

    Control flow: if/else, ternary, switch.  ✅

    Loops: for, while, for...of.  ✅

    Functions: declarations, expressions, arrow functions. 

    Practice: 10 small problems (FizzBuzz, factorial, reverse string, palindrome).

Week 2 (Intermediate — 7 days)

    Arrays & objects (map, filter, reduce, find, splice).

    ES6+: template strings, destructuring, spread/rest, default params.

    DOM basics: querySelector, addEventListener, manipulate DOM nodes.

    Practice: build a small todo list (static) — add/delete items (no storage yet).

Week 3 (Intermediate → Project)

    Local storage: persist todos.

    Fetch API basics + Promises + async/await.

    Mini project: Weather app using open API (fetch + DOM).

    Practice: Debounce input, error handling.

Week 4–5 (React intro + polish)

    React basics: create-react-app / Vite, components, props, state, hooks (useState, useEffect).

    Build: Notes app or Simple blog (React frontend only).

    Learn routing (React Router) and form handling.

    Deploy one app (Netlify/Vercel) for portfolio.

Daily Rule (non-negotiable):

    1 small focused task → finish it → commit → push.

    If stuck >30 min, search, try, then implement minimal working solution — no perfectionism at start.
