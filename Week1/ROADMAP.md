Week1 Roadmap (expanded)

Goal: Finish core JS basics for Week 1 so Week 2 (DOM) is smooth.

Completed / Present in files:
- JS syntax, operators, object basics (`Day1.js`) ✅
- Conditionals, loops, object/array manipulation (`Day2.js`) ✅
- Functions, arrow functions, many array methods, and practice problems (`Day3.js`) ✅

Suggested completion checklist (week1):
Immediate next task (focus on this now):

> Day 5: 10 Small Problems — implement these exercises in `Week1/Day5.js` (priority)

- FizzBuzz (1..n -> Fizz/Buzz/FizzBuzz)
- Reverse string (without using built-ins for extra challenge)
- Palindrome check (ignore spaces/punctuation)
- Factorial (iterative or recursive)
- Sum of array (using reduce)

After Day 5 is complete, move to:

1. Day 6: Array helpers practice (filter/reduce/find)
2. Day 7: ES6+ features (template literals, destructuring, spread/rest, default params, modules)

Study order recommendation (what to learn next):
1. Finish Week1 checklist above (small problems + ES6 additions)
2. DOM basics (querySelector, addEventListener, DOM manipulation)
3. Build a static Todo (add/delete) — no storage
4. Learn fetch / promises / async-await
5. Local Storage (persist todos)
6. Build the mini weather app (API + DOM)

Notes & tips:
- Practice by building tiny focused exercises. For example: implement fizzbuzz, then implement reverse string without using built-ins.
- Use console.log frequently to inspect values.
- Make small commits for each completed task (e.g., "Add fizzbuzz and reverse string").
- When comfortable, pair the DOM tasks with small CSS so you can deploy a simple static site.
